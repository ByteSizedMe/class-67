The rabbit got to the halfway point and could not see the turtle anywhere.
 He was hot and tired and decided to stop and take a short nap.
  Even if the turtle passed him, he would be able to race to the finish line ahead of him.
   All this time the turtle kept walking step by step by step. He never quit no matter how hot or tired he got.
    He just kept going.

However, the rabbit slept longer than he had thought and woke up.
 He could not see the turtle anywhere! He went at full speed to the finish line but found the turtle there waiting for him.
